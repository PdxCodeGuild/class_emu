"""
Let's build a simple board game that runs on the terminal. We'll represent the board using a list of lists. We'll use
two ints to represent that player's position on the board. Every iteration of the game loop, the user will be prompted
for a command. Start with the code below, and add your own modifications.

Changed the icons to be sea themed
allow the user to go around the world
changed the directions to be nautically themed

The goal is to go around the world (there's a check to make sure you made it around the world)
If you encounter a pirate (skull and crossbones) you have to choose a weapon to fight them with.
Cannon beats musket (more power), musket beats sword (more power), sword beats cannon (more agility)
